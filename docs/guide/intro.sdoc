# Introduction to SDOC
{
    # What is SDOC?
    {
        SDOC is a plain text format for writing structured documentation. It uses explicit brace scoping instead of relying on whitespace or indentation to define document structure.

        Every SDOC document is a tree of scopes. A scope has a heading and a body enclosed in braces:

        ```
# My Section
{
    Content goes here.
}
        ```

        Scopes nest naturally:

        ```
# Outer
{
    # Inner
    {
        Nested content.
    }
}
        ```

        Heading depth is determined by nesting, not by the number of `#` characters. A single `#` is all you need.
    }

    # Why SDOC?
    {[.]
        - Explicit structure: braces make scope boundaries unambiguous
        - Familiar formatting: emphasis, links, code, and lists work like Markdown
        - Easy references: tag any scope with `@id` and link to it with `@id` in text
        - No hidden metadata: only IDs you write exist in the document
        - Simple parsing: line-oriented grammar, easy to implement in any language
    }

    # Core Concepts
    {
        # Scopes
        {
            A scope is the fundamental building block. It has a heading line starting with `#`, an optional `@id` tag, and a body block in braces.

            ```
# Section Title @section-id
{
    Body text here.
}
            ```
        }

        # Inline Formatting
        {
            Inside paragraphs and headings, SDOC supports:

            {[.]
                - `*emphasis*` for *emphasis*
                - `**strong**` for **strong**
                - `~~strikethrough~~` for ~~strikethrough~~
                - `` `code` `` for `code`
                - `[label](url)` for links
                - `![alt](url)` for images
                - `<https://example.com>` for autolinks
                - `@id` for references to other scopes
            }
        }

        # Lists
        {
            Bulleted and numbered lists can be written with explicit list blocks or with shorthand:

            ```
# Explicit list
{[.]
    - Item one
    - Item two
}

# Implicit list (inside a normal scope)
{
    - Also works
    - Like this
}
            ```
        }
    }
}
