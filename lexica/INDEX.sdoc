    - **lexica-design.sdoc** (doc) — Design document for Lexica, the knowledge
      organisation system for AI agents. Covers the problem statement, file
      structure, directory convention, progressive disclosure model, MCP
      server interface, and design decisions. Read before making changes to
      the Lexica system.
    - **lexica-plan.sdoc** (doc) — Step-by-step implementation plan for Lexica.
      Tracks phase status (convention, parser extensions, VS Code
      integration) and deferred work. Read to understand what has been built
      and what remains.
    - **lexica.sdoc** (doc) — Lexica is a system for organising project
      knowledge so that AI agents and developers can find what they need,
      when they need it, without drowning in irrelevant context. It uses a
      single \`lexica/\` directory placed at any level of a project tree,
      with tooling that lets agents navigate knowledge progressively rather
      than loading everything at once.
    - **requirements.sdoc** (doc) — Why SDOC exists and what it must achieve.
      Defines ten abstract requirements (R1-R10) and concrete implementation
      constraints (C1-C6). Read before proposing spec changes or new
      features.
    - **sdoc-authoring.sdoc** (skill) — How to write correct SDOC files. Covers
      document structure, inline formatting, block types (lists, tables,
      code, blockquotes), and common mistakes. Read the Quick Reference for
      everyday authoring. Read Common Mistakes before generating SDOC for
      the first time.
    - **specification.sdoc** (doc) — The formal SDOC v0.1 specification. Defines
      syntax for scopes, lists, tables, code blocks, inline formatting,
      references, and the meta scope. Includes the formal EBNF grammar. Read
      for edge cases and parser behaviour questions.
    - **status.sdoc** (doc) — Current state of the SDOC project. Tracks what is
      completed, what is in progress, and what is next. Read this first when
      starting a new task.
    - **suggestions.sdoc** (doc) — Proposed additions to the SDOC spec. Each
      suggestion references requirements it serves, includes priority, and
      explains rationale. Check here before designing new features.
